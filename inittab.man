.TH inittab 5
'''
.SH NAME
{/etc/inittab} - \fBinit\fR(8) configuration file.
'''
.SH DESCRIPTION
Inittab lists processes init should run, along with environment to pass to them.
.P
Upon startup, and each time reconfiguration request is received from \fBtelinit\fR(8),
init parses inittab and stores it in its memory. During normal operation init does not
make any attempts to read inittab.
.P
Init only accepts fully valid inittabs. In case init encounters incorrect syntax
while parsing inittab, it reports error via \fBtelinit\fR(8) and/or \fBsyslog\fR(3)
and retains its internal configuration. All parts of inittab parsed before the error
are discarded.
'''
.SH SYNTAX
Inittab is a text file parsed in linewise manner. Empty lines are ignored.
.IP "# \fIcomment\fR" 4
Lines starting with # are ignored by init
.IP "\fIvariable\fR=\fIvalue\fR" 4
Add \fIvariable\fR to the environment to be passed to processes started by init.
Note init itself does not use environment variables in any way.
.IP "\fIname\fR:\fIrunlevels\fR:\fIflags\fR:\fIcommand\fR" 4
Define a process to be started by init. Each process entry carries a single pid value,
so there can be at most one running process for each entry at any given time.
.IP "\fB@\fIdirectory" 4
Include service files from \fIdirectory\fR.
.P
All lines are processes top-to-bottom. The relative order of environment and process lines
is irrelevant, all spawned processes will get exactly the same environment. Processes from
included service files are placed at the point where relevant \fB@\fIdirectory\fR line was.
However, the order of files within directory is not defined.
'''
.SS Naming entries
\fIname\fR is a string used to identify this entry, in particular when stopping/starting
processes with \fBtelinit\fR(8) and during reconfiguration. May be empty. If non-empty,
should be unique, however init does not enforce this.
'''
.SS Runlevels
\fIrunlevels\fR field defines runlevel bitmask for this entry: \fB234\fR means the process
will be started on runlevels 2, 3 and 4, and stopped when not in any of these runleves.
Empty value is allowed, meaning "all but 0".
'''
.SS Process Flags
\fIflags\fR is a comma-separated list of process flags:
.IP "wait" 4
Do not restart the process, and do not proceed further until it dies. If there are 
proccesses with "once" flag set, wait until all of the die before running a "wait" process.
.IP "once" 4
Do not restart the process. Unlike \fBwait\fR, do proceed to run subsequent processes.
.IP "respawn" 4
Restart the process in case it dies. This flag does nothing, restarting is the default
mode of operation for init.
.IP "null" 4
Open /dev/null on file descriptors 0, 1 and 2 (stdin, stdout and stderr) for the spawned process.
Without this flag, the process inherits init's descriptors, typically /dev/console.
.IP "log" 4
Redirect file descriptors 1 and 2 to {/var/log}\fIname\fR for the spawned process.
.IP "abort" 4
Send SIGABRT instead of SIGTERM when stopping the process. Use if the process in question
fails to die on SIGTERM.
.IP "tty" 4
Set up controlling tty for the process. See TIOCSCTTY in tty_ioctl(4). Use for interactive
shells started by init. This flag is equivalent to "-" before the command is sysvinit and
some other init implementations. 
'''
.SS Commands
The last field, \fIcommand\fR, is the command to run. The field is parsed and passed as
the second argument to \fBexecve\fR(2) call.

Unless specifically told otherwise, init does not call \fBsh\fR(1) to handle the command,
and only does limited command parsing on its own. Single and double quotes are handled
properly, but variable substitution, output redirects, compound statements etc. and not
supported. Also, $PATH, even if set, has no effect; use absolute names for executables
instead.

To use sh, prepend ! to the command. This will cause init to pass the command directly to
/bin/sh -c without any parsing.
'''
.SH NOTES
This page describes inittab format for \fBsinit\fR package.
Other init implementations, in particular sysvinit, use different conventions
and in some cases different syntax.
