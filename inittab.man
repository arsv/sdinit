.TH inittab 5
'''
.SH NAME
{/etc/inittab} - \fBinit\fR(8) configuration file.
'''
.SH DESCRIPTION
Inittab is a list of processes init should run, along with environment to pass to them.
.P
Upon startup, and each time reconfiguration is requested by \fBtelinit\fR(8),
init parses inittab and stores it in its memory. During normal operation init does not
make any attempts to re-read inittab.
'''
.SH SYNTAX
Inittab is a text file parsed in linewise manner. Empty lines are ignored.
.IP "# \fIcomment\fR" 4
Lines starting with # are ignored by init
.IP "\fIvariable\fR=\fIvalue\fR" 4
Add \fIvariable\fR to the environment to be passed to processes started by init.
.IP "\fImode\fR  \fIname\fR  \fIcommand\fR" 4
Define a process to be started by init. Each process entry carries a single pid value,
so there can be at most one running process for each entry at any given time.
.P
All lines are processes top-to-bottom. The relative order of environment and process lines
is irrelevant, all spawned processes will get exactly the same environment.
'''
.SS Entry mode
\fImode\fR is a set of characters specifying how to run this entry, and which runlevels to run it on.
.IP "S" 4
Start the process, and keep restarting it in case it dies. This is the default mode, and "S" may be skipped.
.IP "W" 4
Wait for this process. Do not restart it, and do not proceed further until it dies. If there are 
proccesses with "once" flag set, wait until all of the die before running a "wait" process.
.IP "E" 4
Run once. Do not restart the process. Unlike \fBwait\fR, do proceed to run subsequent entries.
.IP "H" 4
Hold this process. Like S, but wait for this process to die before proceeding to kill other processes.
See below for possible applications.
.P
Only one of SWOH should be used for an entry. This is called "entry type", so a w-type entry
is one with "W" character in mode field.
Redirect file descriptors 1 and 2 to {/var/log}\fIname\fR for the spawned process.
.IP "0...9" 4
Run this entry on specified runlevel(s).
.IP "a...f" 4
Run this entry only if specified sublevel(s) are active.
.IP "~" 4
Invert runlevels mask, run this entry on all runlevels except those specified with 0...9.
.IP "-" 4
Silently ignored; may be used to align runlevel masks.
.IP "A" 4
Send SIGABRT instead of SIGTERM when stopping the process. Use if the process in question
fails to die on SIGTERM.
.P
Examples: "W123" start on runlevels 1, 2 or 3, wait;
"S01~" (re)start on all runlevels except 0 and 1; "S--2-4A" (re)start on runlevels 2 and 4,
use SIGABRT to kill the process.
'''
.SS Naming entries
\fIname\fR is a string used to identify this entry, in particular when stopping/starting
processes with \fBtelinit\fR(8), as well as in syslog messages.
Use "-" to denote empty name. Non-empty names should be unique.
.P
During reconfiguration, init matches entries with the same name, and transfers pids from
the old configuration. For un-named entries, and in case names do not match, the old
process gets killed and the new one started. This is mostly relevant for s-type entries.
'''
.SS Commands
The last field, \fIcommand\fR, is the command to run. The field is parsed and passed as
the second argument to \fBexecve\fR(2) call.

Unless specifically told otherwise, init does not call \fBsh\fR(1) to handle the command,
and only does limited command parsing on its own. Single and double quotes are handled
properly, but variable substitution, output redirects, compound statements etc. and not
supported. Also, $PATH, even if set, has no effect; use absolute names for executables
instead.

To use sh, prepend ! to the command. This will cause init to pass the command directly to
/bin/sh -c without any parsing.
'''
.SH USAGE
'''
\fBinit\fR keeps runlevel mask to determine which subset of the entries should
be running.
.P
At any point, init is in one of runlevels 0, 1, ... 9, with zero or more
sublevels a, b, ..., f activated. Each entry has its own runlevel mask, with zero
or more runlevels and zero or more sublevels. If an entry has current runlevel in its
mask, and all sublevels from its mask are active, it is started. Otherwise, the entry
gets killed.
.P
Example: "S123" entry is started on runlevel 1 but killed on runlevel 4; "S1ab" is started
on runlevels 1ab, 1abc, but not on 1 or 1a or 1ac or 2.
.P
The entries are always started in top-to-bottom order, and killed bottom-to-top.
Entry type determines how process death is handled: w-type entries are waited for, s-type
entries are restarted and so on.
.P
Current runlevel may be changed using \fBtelinit\fR(8).
.P
All w-type and o-type entries are run upon entering specific runlevel.
To run an entry on exit from a specific runlevel, negate that runlevel:
"W3~" entry will be run when switching from runlevel 3 to any other runlevel.
'''
.SS Slippery runlevels
Runlevels 7, 8 and 9 are designated "slippery".
.P
When init reaches a regular, non-slippery runlevel, it stays there; "reaches"
here means all w-type and o-type entries have been run and exited.
With slippery runlevels however, init starts switching back to the original runlevel
immediately after reaching a slippery one.
.P
Slippery runlevels are intended to be used for sleep and suspend states, or generally
for any system state that coincides with a process (a w-type entry in init terms) running.
'''
.SH NOTES
This page describes inittab format for \fB{INIT}\fR package.
Other init implementations, in particular sysvinit, use different conventions
and in some cases different syntax.
