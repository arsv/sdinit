This a sample initdir both possible formats of service files. 

    xftp
	A shell script (interpreted executable) used as a service
	file. Note #! on the first line and #: on the second.

    xinetd~
	A simple service file. The command in the file would
	be parsed and stored the same way with lines in inittab.
	Tilde means it is disabled and will not be executed.

    README
	Just a text file that is neither a script nor a service
	file. Its name starts with [A-Z] so init will ignore it
	(see skipdirent() in ../../init_conf_dir.c)

    sys/
	An unrelated directory. This, too, will be ignored by init.
	In particular, init will not read any files in that directory.

Note all these files will be executed in ../.. (top source dir)
