# This is a example of an executable script used as a service file.
# Note #! on the first line, and #: on the second line.
# When init detects both, it will use #: line for runlevels as flags,
# but the command will be "/path/to/this/httpd"
#
# The equivalent initline is
# httpd:2345:log:!/sbin/httpd
