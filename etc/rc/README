This a sample initdir both possible formats of service files. 

    xinetd
	A simple service file. The command in the file will
	be parsed and stored the same way with lines in inittab.

    httpd	
	A shell script (interpreted executable) used as a service
	file. Note #! on the first line and #: on the second.

    README
	Just a text file that is neither a script nor a service
	file; sinit will ignore it. 

    sys/	
	An unrelated directory. This, too, will be ignored by sinit.
	In particular, sinit will read anything in that directory.
