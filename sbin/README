The files here are stub executables intended to be used with ../etc/inittab
for test runs in source directory.

Proper (non-script) executables are set to be host-compiled.
This is because qemu-(arch) ./init translates syscalls to the underlying
native kernel, and native execve naturally expects native executables.

Testing with qemu-system-(arch) would require target-compiled trap,
but there are much more interesting things to run with qemu-system.


Signal trapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
trap should be used as a generic foreground daemon substitute.
See ../etc/inittab for examples. All it does is dying on pre-set
intervals (showing you how respawning works) and annouces received
signals (showing signal operation in init).

trap exits by calling _exit from signal handlers.
init reports it as "exited", not as "killed by (signal)".
That's correct behavior. Use SIGSEGV or SIGILL or SIGBUS to check
termination by a signal.


Syslog
~~~~~~
slogdg and slogst are syslogd stubs, using DGRAM and STREAM sockets
respectively. Both dump all received messages to stdout.

Unless there is a very good reason to do otherwise, use DGRAM implementation.

Check ../config.h for the proper socket name.
This naturaly only makes sense in devel mode.

Neither stub is called syslogd to avoid confusion with the actual syslog
presumably running in the system.

logger is a simple syslog client to check slogdg and slogst.
When running, make sure to use the same socket name for the slog* and logger.
