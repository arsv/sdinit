The files here are stub executables intended to be used with ../etc/inittab
for test runs in source directory.

Note trap.c is set to be host-compiled. This is because qemu-(arch) ./init
translates syscalls to the underlying native kernel, and native execve
naturally expects native executables.

Testing with qemu-system-(arch) would require target-compiled trap,
but there are much more interesting things to run with qemu-system
so trap is assumed to be host-only.
