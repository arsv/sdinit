A lot of minimalistic init implementations are loosed based
on David J. Bernsteins's daemontools.

Their shared feature is a dedicated respawner with uniform, unordered
S-entries and lack of runlevels. Handling of sequential W-entries is
typically delegated to some kind of shell scripts.

A number of inits (including sninit) are based on the original sysvinit.
These tend to have sequential list with S-entries and W-entries intermixed,
and optionally runlevels.

Dependency-based init systems manage a tree of implicitly-ordered entries. 
The order in which the entries are started is determined at runtime,
similar to how make orders targets to be rebuilt.

Another approach to init design is to drop respawner altogether,
with the assumption that the daemons are truly immortal.
PID files and daemon(3) originate from this branch of design.

    SysV-style initscripts, several implementations, for instance:
        https://git.fedorahosted.org/git/initscripts.git
    BSD rc scripts, see intro here:
        https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/porters-handbook/rc-scripts.html
    https://gist.github.com/rofl0r/6168719 (minit aka minimal init)
    http://git.suckless.org/sinit 

Both SysV and BSD scripts need a dedicated reaper process. The common approach
back at the time was to use sysvinit, which also handled few S-entries like
gettys. Another approach is to use a dedicated minimalistic reaper like minit
or suckless init.

Yet another option is "wait" shell built-in, which allows making init into
a single sh script. With no respawner, it is in fact possible.
