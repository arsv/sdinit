dietlibc configuration notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Certain features in dietlibc can be enabled/disabled with #defines
in dietfeatures.h. Most have little effect on sinit, but some
can be used to reduce its size slightly.

Use "readelf -s init | sort -k3" to check for bloat.
Common culprit is stackgap(), which is a generic initialization
routine in dietlibc. 


#undef WANT_VALGRIND_SUPPORT
#undef WANT_THREAD_SAFE
#undef WANT_TLS
	all three reduce the size of stackgap()

#undef WANT_GNU_STARTUP_BLOAT

#undef WANT_FASTER_STRING_ROUTINES
#undef WANT_FULL_POSIX_COMPAT
