Development configuration allows running sninit executable right in the source
directory, with a set of stub "daemons". This way specific configurations,
reaction to telinit commands and overall behavior can be checked quickly without
setting up a virtual machine of some sort.

To configure init for a devel build, run

    ./configure devel

from the source directory. This command disables optimization and changes
config locations to ./etc/inittab and ./etc/initdir among other things.

The test "daemons" and "startup scripts" are in ./sbin/ directory. Run

    make sbin

to build them. Once everything is built, run init:

    ./init

and use telinit to query it:

    ./telinit ?

At this point, if necessary, you can run any of them under gdb.



Note when configuring, arch= may be supplied as well for a cross-build.
The resulting executables can be run via qemu, see qemu.txt on this.

Executables in sbin/ are never cross-compiled, so the same configuration
will work even when the init itself is being run via qemu.
