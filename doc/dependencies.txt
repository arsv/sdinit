On systemd-style dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Early in the project there were plans to have systemd-style dependecies
between initrecs.  This idea has been abandoned completely in favor
of much simplier w/o/s-type initrecs.

My opinion is that it's a bad solution looking for a problem.

1. Strict dependencies can not be implemented reliably in unix.
2. Weak dependencies make no sense during system startup,
   and later can be better implemented outside of init.
3. I'm yet to see any good use case.

Strict dependency here means a dependency that can prevent a service
from starting, or suspend/delay startup.
Any other dependency is a weak dependency.
In systemd terms:
	strict: Requires, Requisite, BindsTo, Before, After
	weak: Wants and PartOf

Weak dependencies are equivalent to aliasing telinit commands:

	telinit (action) web = telinit (action) httpd named mysqld,

with action being start, stop, restart and so on.

The only kind of dependency that can be implemented reliably
is dependency on process death. These can be used to (re)order
initrecs, ensuring particular sequence of events during runlevel
switching. Currently sinit relies completely on the order or lines
in inittab, and does not allow changing it. See Reordering entries below.



#1: No init-enforced strict dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_of_check_to_time_of_use

Processes in unix are timed independently.
Init can never rely on process state data it has, except for
status part of (pid, status) pair returned by wait(2).

In particular, "(process) is running" condition is invalid in init,
and there's no way to tell between a process that failed to start
and process that started but failed later.

This is an inherent feature of unix, and most daemons are written
with this assumption is mind. All init should do is to start a daemon,
and let it sort things out.
In case daemon dies, init should restart it.
Why did the daemon die? Not init's business.

Timing condition may be imposed externally to distinguish between
running and failing processes. Sysvinit does it, as well as systemd.
However, like pretty much any timed thing in non-realtime unix,
those conditions are both artificial and unreliable.


#2: Weak dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These only make sense in telinit commands after the system has been
brought up. Because they are purely syntactic and do not affect init
operation at all, they can be done using shell aliases and/or shell scripts.

Atop of that, who needs them? Which leads to...


#3: Use cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When are dependencies needed?

* It makes sense to start syslogd before anything else, to catch all messages.
  However, it hardly makes sense to abort boot process if syslogd fails to start.
  So, not a dependency.
  Note "fails to start" = "goes down" due to independent process timing.

* Some daemons need network to start. Or do they? 
  Network can go down at any moment, and daemons must be able to handle it.
  See "goes down" above.

* In some pathological cases daemons may depend on each other.
  I can only recall one such pair, smbd/nmbd, and those were fixed years ago.
  Again, consider one of the daemons going down.

* Parts of system state configuration (network interfaces, netfilter, time, sysctl,
  proc, sys and so on) are generally independent from each other, and most of the time
  are special cases anyway.

* Mountpoints are a part of system state, see the point above.
  The idea is that the filesystem must be set up early (as a part of the global
  system state) and daemons should not care about its layout.
  And once again, time of check time of use.

I can't think of anything else.
Bottom line: set up system state, then start everything.
No need to babysit daemons, they are quite capable on their own.


On mountpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It can be argued that mountpoints (specifically, successfully mounting something
somewhere) do make (half-)valid dependencies that can be useful.

A simple example: solid-state / with system, /var/cache/squid on rotating media,
and squid that should only be started if the cache partition is available.

sinit approach in cases like this is to start everything, regardless.
Upon not finding its cache directories, squid will die. Or upon finding them read-only.
There is always a way to move relevant checks to the daemon and/or its startup scripts,
closer to the point of actual use.

Proceeding as far as possible gives root an option to access the host and fix the system.
This is opposite of a really annoying Arch initscripts feature,
which would shut down the system if there was a minor problem during startup.

There is possibility that proceeding may compromise system security.
Think of iptables failing while the rest of the system including network does start.
This however requires extensive damage to the system, and thus makes the point
of protecting it from within moot. Think of iptables.conf being readable but truncated.
So it is not something that should be done in init.


Reordering entries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One possible application of proper explicit dependencies is forcing different entry
ordering for different runlevel pairs when switching. For example,

	:25:wait:e1
	:25:wait:e2

can only be executed as "e1; e2" with current code, there is no way to make it "e1; e2"
when going 0->2 and "e2; e1" when going 3->5.
This isn't really important for w-type entries, since it's easy to implement different
orders by duplicating entries:

	:5:wait:e2
	:25:wait:e1
	:2:wait:e2

Now the real problems is this:

	syslog:::/sbin/syslogd
	httpd:::/sbin/httpd
	ftpd:::/sbin/ftpd

When going to runlevel 0, syslog will be sent SIGTERM first (well, actually "together" with
the other two, since it will be done in a single initpass), possibly dying first and thus
not catching final messages from httpd and ftpd. The correct order is to kill() httpd and ftpd,
wait until they die, kill syslog, wait until it dies, and only then proceed further, possibly
unmounting /var and so on.

There is no solution for this for now, other than not caring about those messsages,
or not stopping syslog at all:

	syslog:~::/sbin/syslog 

Generic handling require global changes in the way initpass works.
Too much hassle for a very limited problem, syslogd is the only daemon I can think of
that needs such treatment.
