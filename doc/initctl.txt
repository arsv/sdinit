initctl protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Communication between init and telinit happens via a SOCK_STREAM
unix domain socket, usually named @initctl ("\0initctl", see unix(7)).

Only one command is transmitted per connection. To transmit more,
telinit must reconnect.
Whenever applicable, only one argument is transmitted per connection.
In other words, "telinit stop httpd ftpd ntpd" opens connection 3 times
and sends 3 commands: "stop httpd", "stop ftpd", "stop ntpd", one
for each connection.

Telinit (client) talks first, sending the command and write-closing
its side of the connection. Init (server) replies with a free-form
stream of data, which telinit is expected to pass to stderr.

Commands themselves consist of one-letter command code, followed by
optinal argument.

Possible commands (see init_cmds.c for a full list):

	?	output current state and list of running processes
	=N	switch to (primary) runlevel N
	+L	activate secondary runlevel L
	-L	deactivate secondary runlevel L
	rname	stop process "name"
	dname	disable/stop process "name"
	ename	enable/start process "name"
	q	reconfigure
	R	reboot   = switch to runlevel 0, call reboot(LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_REBOOT)
	H	halt     = switch to runlevel 0, call reboot(LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_HALT)
	P	poweroff = switch to runlevel 0, call reboot(LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_POWEROFF)

Current implementation does not indicate whether the command failed or not,
so telinit always exits with code 0. This is almost inevitable, given most
commands are deferred: the command itself only sets a flag, and the action
is performed during initpass() (see init_pass.c) after closing telinit
connection.
