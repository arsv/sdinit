initctl protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Communication between init and telinit happens via a SOCK_STREAM
unix domain socket, usually named @initctl ("\0initctl", see unix(7)).

Only one command is transmitted per connection. To transmit more,
telinit must reconnect.
Whenever applicable, only one argument is transmitted per connection.
In other words, "telinit stop httpd ftpd ntpd" opens connection 3 times
and sends 3 commands: "stop httpd", "stop ftpd", "stop ntpd", one
for each connection.

Telinit (client) talks first, sending the command and write-closing
its side of the connection. Init (server) replies with a free-form
stream of data, which telinit is expected to pass to stderr.

Commands themselves consist of one-letter command code, followed by
optional argument.

Possible commands:

	?	output current state and list of running processes
	5	switch to (primary) runlevel 5
	4e	switch to runlevel 4e
	+a	activate secondary runlevel a
	-cd	deactivate secondary runlevels c and d
	rname	restart process "name"
	dname	disable process "name"
	ename	enable process "name"
	sname	start process "name"
	tname	stop process "name"
	pname	pause process "name" (send SIGSTOP)
	wname	resume (wake) process "name" (send SIGCONT)
	hname	send SIGHUP to process "name"
	q	reconfigure
	R	reboot   = switch to runlevel 0, call reboot(CMD_REBOOT)
	H	halt     = switch to runlevel 0, call reboot(CMD_HALT)
	P	poweroff = switch to runlevel 0, call reboot(CMD_POWEROFF)
	S	sleep = switch to runlevel 8, assumed to be slippery
Check parsecmd() in init_cmds.c for a full list, and cmdtbl[] in telinit.c
for corresponding telinit commands.

Current implementation does not indicate whether the command failed or not,
so telinit always exits with code 0. This is nearly inevitable, since most
commands are deferred: the command itself only sets a flag, and the action
is performed during initpass() after closing telinit connection.
