The new inittab format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Up to some point during development, sninit used sysvinit-style
inittab format ("sysvtab" for short):

	name:rlvls:flags:command

Later on, the format has been changed to crontab-style "newtab":

	name	runflags    command

Note whitespace-separated fields, and flags merged with runlevels.

In current implementation, the formats are essentially equivalent. 
SysV-style "wait" and "once" are replaced with "w" and "r" respectively,
rlvls field is used with no changed.


Why a new format?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Less ugly and better fitting sninit's internal representation.

The initial idea of sninit features called for a rather elaborate
per-entry configuration. Back then, having one field for runlevels
and another one for comma-separated list of value kinda made sense.

	httpd:2345:respawn,uid=apache,gid=apache:/sbin/httpd

As development progressed, this evolved into
	
	httpd:::/sbin/runcap apache@apache /sbin/httpd

while w-type entries started to look like

	::wait:/sbin/whatever

and it made less and less sense to shoehorn it into sysvinit format,
pretty ugly to begin with.

Wherever things may be aligned, it's better to keep them aligned, so : were
replaced with whitespace separators. And since sninit had already crontab-style
environment variables, the whole thing started to look more like crontab.

Atop of that, sninit was never a drop-in replacement for sysvinit,
and was not meant to be. So instead of somehow accepting somewhat compatible
configuration with a different semantics (that is, a sysv-style inittab),
the choice was made to reject it loudly.


Field order
~~~~~~~~~~~
SysV-style field order (name-...-command) has been kept intact.
Command is the most variable part, so there is no other place to put it.
Between flags-name- and name-flags-, the latter has been chosen
to faciliate simple grep/sed operations on entry names:

	/^name\>/

Matching the 2nd field would require explicit pattern for the flags.
