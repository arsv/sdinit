/* FD polling and telinit communication.

Call order:
   main() calls pollfds()
   pollfds sets state |= S_INITCTL
   main checks for state & S_INITCTL and calls acceptctl()

The separation of pollfds and acceptctl is necessary to reap deceased
children before interpreting commands. That, in turn, is not really
necessary but makes the output clear, both for ? and child control.

The actual command processing happens in init_cmds.c, these routines
only receive them. */
