/* FD polling and telinit communication.

   Call order:

       main() calls pollfds()
       pollfds sets state |= S_INITCTL
       main checks for state & S_INITCTL and calls acceptctl()

   The separation of pollfds and acceptctl is necessary to reap deceased
   children before interpreting commands. That, in turn, is not really
   necessary but makes the output clear, both for ? and for child control.

   The actual command processing happens in init_cmds.c, these routines
   only receive them. */

   to connect, so it's init who suffers.

   A simple solution could be replying as fast as possible, but it's not

   a connection attempt.

   The only real protection is closing the listening socket.
