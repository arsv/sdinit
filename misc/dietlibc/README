Patches for dietlibc-0.33 adding/fixing some stuff needed for sninit.
Dietlibc with these pathes applied is called dietlibc-fixed in configure.

The patches have been merged into https://github.com/ensc/dietlibc
and some of the issues are now also fixed in the mainline CVS.

All this barely make sense now with the bundled libc available.
