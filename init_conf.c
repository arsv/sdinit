/* How reconfiguring works:

   	0. newblock is mmapped
	1. new config is compiled into newblock
	2. processes not in the new inittab are stopped
	3. remaining pids are transferred from inittab to newblock
	4. newblock replaces inittab, cfgblock is munmapped

   Up until step 4 init uses the old inittab structure, because step 2
   implies waiting for pids that have no place for them in newtab.

   This file only handles step 1. configure() is the entry point.
   It sets up newblock memory block and returns 0 on success.

   In case init gets another reconfigure request while in the main
   loop during step 2, compiled newtab is discarded and we're back to step 1. */

/* Note that until rewirepointers() call late in the process, all pointers
   in struct config, struct initrec and envp aren't real pointers,
   they are offsets from the start of newblock.
   This is to avoid a lot of hassle in case mremap changes the block address. */
