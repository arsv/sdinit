   a bitmask: runlevel 3ab is (1<<3) | (1<<a) | (1<<b).

   Switching between runlevels is initiated by setting nextlevel to something
   other than currlevel. The switch is completed once currlevel = nextlevel.

   runlevel, and initpass() for level-switching code.

   Init starts at runlevel 0, so 0~ entries are not spawned during boot.

/* main(), the entry point also the main loop.

   Overall logic here: interate over inittab records (that's initpass()),
   go sleep in ppoll(), iterate, sleep in ppoll, iterate, sleep in ppoll, ...

   Within this cycle, ppoll is the only place where blocking occurs.
   Even when running a wait entry, init does not use blocking waitpid().
   Instead, it spawns the process and goes to sleep in ppoll until
   the process dies.

   Whenever there's a need to disturb the cycle, flags are raised in $state.
   Any branching to handle particular situation, like child dying or telinit
   knocking on the socket, occurs here in main.

   For time-tracking code, see longish comment near setpasstime() below.
   Time is only checked once for each initpass (that's why "passtime").

   Barring early hard errors, the only way to exit the main loop is switching
   to "no-runlevel" state, which is (currlevel == 0). Note this is different
   from runlevel 0 which is (1<<0). See the block at the end of initpass. */

   Precision is not important here, but keeping sane timeouts is crucial;
   setting poll timeout to 0 consistently by mistake would result in the loop
