x86_32, or in other words, x86_64 with short pointers.
Check ../x86_64/README for ABI and such.


Big fat warning: building sninit for x86_32 is of little benefit.
Negligible net gain over x86_64 in the init process will be likely
offset by (not-so-negligible) increase in the kernel size.

The only situation I can think of that warrants x32 init executable
is a kernel without regular x86_64 syscalls, which is not something
that can be built easily as far as I know.


This arch is more of a experiment for the sake of experiment,
not something intended for real use. It is not well tested too.
