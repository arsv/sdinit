The code assumes ARM EABI.
Both armel and armhf can use it with no changes, but OABI-only kernels can't.

I see no point in supporting (apparently obsolete) OABI.
In case it is needed, use dietlibc which still has OABI support.


ARM EABI calling convention:

                 1   2   3   4   5   6
Syscall     r7 (r0, r1, r2, r3, r4, r5) -> r0
Function       (r0, r1, r2, r3, +0, +4) -> r0		+n = n*4(sp)
