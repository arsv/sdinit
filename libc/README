This is a stripped-down subset of dietlibc, enough to build sninit
but probably not for anything else. See doc/libc.txt for explanation.

Most of the code in this directory is due to Felix von Leitner.
See http://www.fefe.de/dietlibc/ for the original source.

File structure:
	include		generic headers
	*.c    		generic libc routines (string and time)
	ARCH/		machine-specific syscall code
	ARCH/bits/	machine-specific constants
	ARCH/syscalls.h	syscall numbers
	unicall		generic syscall code

There is no Makefile here; libc is built from the top source directory.
