These are libc routines only used for tests (the stuff in test/ directory).
To keep things clear, they are isolated from the "primary" libc parts
which go into the final executables.

The only exception is syscall() which is arch-specific and resides in resp.
arch directories despite not being used anywhere in the final executables.
